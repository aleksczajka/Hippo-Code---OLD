        <label>Hereafter, any items referred to as "ads" or "advertisments" refer to any content promoted or posted on 
        HIPPOHAPPENINGS. <br /><br />
Many laws, regulations and policies, in a variety of jurisdictions, regulate the 
goods and services that may be bought and sold or advertised. Below is a very 
simple, and in no way comprehensive, list of some of the types of prohibited 
and restricted items the advertisement of which is not permitted on HippoHappenings. 
First, see if what you are posting is in violation of the HippoHappenings 
<a class="NavyLink12UD" href="terms-and-conditions">TERMS OF USE</a>.<br /><br />
HippoHappenings users remain responsible for complying with all applicable laws, 
regulations or restrictions on items, services, or manner of sale, payment or exchange, 
that may apply to transactions in which they participate -- including but not limited to
 those imposed by the state of Oregon, where the HippoHappenings service physically resides.
  As we cannot state with any certainty whether you would be in violation of any laws 
  when you post an ad or event, we encourage you to research the applicable city, county,
   state and federal laws and regulations that may apply to your posting.<br /><br />
