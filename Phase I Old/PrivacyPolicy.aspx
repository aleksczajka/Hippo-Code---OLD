        <label>
We here at HippoHappenings value privacy as much as you do. Any and all information collected by HippoHappenings is never sold or shared (unless we are forced to comply with a state, federal or court mandate) with anyone. Any marketing done with your information is for the betterment of services offered by this site and this site alone. 
Basically, if you are not selling weaponized bateria or sharing child porn, the information you supply to us stays with us.
